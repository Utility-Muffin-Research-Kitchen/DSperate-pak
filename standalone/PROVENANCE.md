## Patches

The five patches are locked by sha256 in `upstream.lock.json`; the build
applies them in order and refuses a patch whose hash differs.

Reviewed against [upstream v2.1.1](https://github.com/beebono/DSperate/releases/tag/v2.1.1)
on 2026-09-21:

| Patch | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 0001 archive/cache policy | Keep and rebase. v2.1.1 renamed `find_nds` to `find_rom` and widened the entry kinds to `.nds/.dsi/.srl/.cia`; the cache-root, single-entry and unsafe-path policies are still absent upstream, so they are re-expressed against `find_rom`. |
| 0002 save durability | Keep. Re-anchored onto v2.1.1's larger SDL frontend; checked writes and firmware flush/close are unchanged. |
| 0003 lid/resume | Keep. v2.1.1's lid implementation is unchanged and still fabricates a close on a device with no switch. |
| 0004 deterministic `--version` | New. Prefers the lock's tag and commit over git so a source archive and a patched checkout report the same identity. |
| 0005 Leaf account adapter | New. The `standalone-ra-account-v1` consumer; upstream has no equivalent. |

`standalone/patches/0001-pak-cache-and-archive-policy.patch` adds the pak's
archive policy.

It adds three opt-in command-line flags and the two settings behind them:

- `--cache-root-only` (`[cart] cache_root_only`): a configured `paths.cache` is
  the only place a deflated archive may be unpacked, never a `.dsperate`
  directory beside a writable ROM. The pak pins the cache to
  `$USERDATA_PATH/dsperate/cache/<key>/`.
- `--single-rom` (`[cart] single_nds`): refuse an archive that holds more than
  one eligible image entry instead of picking one by game database and
  revision. The pak wants one unambiguous game per archive.
- `--inspect-cart FILE`: print `kind`, `extract`, `bytes` and `entry` for a
  cartridge and exit without booting anything, or exit non-zero with the reason
  on stderr. The wrapper sizes and bounds its cache with this and refuses an
  unreadable archive before a window opens.

The same patch rejects an image entry whose name is absolute or carries a `..`
component. Upstream already refuses encryption, zip64 and unknown compression;
this closes the remaining path-shaped case, and the extraction target was never
derived from the entry name in any case.

`standalone/patches/0004-deterministic-version.patch` makes `--version` report
the lock's release tag and commit. Upstream's generator takes the tag from
`git describe` and the commit from `git rev-parse`, so a corresponding-source
archive without git says `unknown` and a patched checkout says `<hash>-dirty`.
The patch prefers `DSPERATE_LOCK_VERSION` and `DSPERATE_LOCK_COMMIT`, which
`build-in-container.sh` exports from the lock, and leaves ordinary git
development unchanged.

`standalone/patches/0005-dsperate-ra-account-adapter.patch` makes DSperate use
the RetroAchievements account saved in Leaf. It adds three files under
`src/cheevos/` and small hooks in the achievement client and the SDL frontend:

- `ra_account_contract.cpp` and `ra_account.h`: the contract classifier, the
  revision marker (`.umrk-ra-account`) and the transition table, the same logic
  as the Flycast consumer and the leaf-contracts reference.
  `make test-ra-account` replays the pinned leaf-contracts fixtures through
  this classifier.
- `ra_account_bridge.cpp`: captures `UMRK_RA_ACCOUNT_*` (and a leaked
  `JAWAKA_CHEEVOS_*` pair) into private memory and unsets them as the first
  thing the frontend does. It picks the transition, writes the marker as
  pending before a login, and hands the password to the native rcheevos login
  once. A verified token goes through the adapter's own checked writer: a
  0600 temporary in the same directory, then write, `fsync`, close and rename,
  each checked. Only after that does the marker become accepted. Any failure
  leaves the previous files in place and keeps the revision pending.
- An explicit `cheevos.enabled = false` (global or per-game INI) or
  `--no-cheevos` is decided before the handoff is consumed and wins over the
  managed account. The handoff is still captured and scrubbed, but nothing
  signs in and neither the marker nor the token is touched.
- Bridge failures are queued as notices that the achievement client drains
  into its own pop-up queue, the path upstream's sign-in failure uses. The
  frontend shows them even with `cheevos.toasts` off.
- Unmanaged launches keep upstream behavior: a menu sign-in lasts for the
  session and is not written anywhere. Upstream reads
  `<Config::dir()>/cheevos.token` but never writes one, and the Leaf wrapper
  gives every game its own `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, so persisting there would
  scatter tokens across per-game directories.
- The account page says `MANAGED BY LEAF`, offers no manual sign-in for a
  managed account, and keeps its sign-out session-only.

The wrapper passes the managed directory as `--managed-account-dir`
(`$USERDATA_PATH/dsperate/retroachievements`). It copies and unsets the
snapshot before any helper runs and restores it only for the emulator's
`exec`. It passes a leaked RetroArch pair on by presence only, never by value.

The cache-root and single-ROM policies default off. Unsafe archive entry
names are rejected regardless of those flags.

`standalone/patches/0003-lid-resume-no-fabricated-close.patch` stops the
host-resume lid pulse from fabricating a close on a device with no lid switch
(the MLP1). Upstream pulses the emulated lid whenever the clocks show a suspend
it did not see, which on these devices is every resume. A game that blanks its
screens on lid-close and restores them only on an open it saw coming (Contra 4)
then stays black; emulation, audio and input all keep running. The pulse now
fires only for a lid already believed closed, so with no switch nothing happens
and the screens survive a resume.

`standalone/patches/0002-save-durability.patch` makes battery-save and
save-state writes durable. Upstream writes to `<file>.tmp`, closes it without
checking the result, and renames. A buffered write on a full or read-only card
can report success from `fwrite` and still never reach the disk, so a save
reported as successful might not be there. The patch adds a checked helper
(`write_file_durable`): `fwrite`, `fflush`, `fsync`, `fclose` and `rename` are
all checked, the temporary is removed on failure, and the previous committed
file is left untouched. It also checks the firmware-override flush and close.
A failed battery save stays dirty, so the next flush retries.

Save loading now follows upstream v2.0.0. For a known chip, upstream loads the
portion that fits and saves the original mismatched file as `.bak`; for an
unknown chip, a supported save size selects the chip. This is different from
refusing every short save. The removed guard read into live SRAM before checking
the count, so it did not actually undo partial reads even in the old patch.
The checked-write helper covers DS battery saves and save-state files, not
upstream's new DSi NAND/SD persistence or mismatch-backup writes.

Upstream writes state format 3 and accepts DS format 2 from v1.15.1. This is a
source-reviewed compatibility promise, not a device migration test. Back up your
states before updating: v1.15.1 cannot read states newly written by v2.0.0.

## Toolchain and flags

Built inside the digest-pinned `mlp1-toolchain` image
(`sha256:66aac16fb8b07e663c9b4d66970f272df195a6eba98dfad8286eabbaa617faf9`)
with the cross prefix `aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu` and the target sysroot at
`/opt/mlp1-toolchain/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu/sysroot`.

CMake configuration (see `standalone/build-in-container.sh`):

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` | `aarch64` | selects the AArch64 JIT and NEON kernels |
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | `RelWithDebInfo` | upstream default; debug info is stripped from the artifact |
| `DSPERATE_TESTS` | `OFF` | no test binaries ship |
| `DSPERATE_HEADLESS` | `OFF` | the measurement harness does not ship |
| `DSPERATE_CHEEVOS` | `ON` | upstream default; libcurl is `dlopen`ed at runtime, not linked |
| `DSPERATE_NET` | `ON` | upstream default; vendored ENet and libslirp are linked statically; network sessions default off |
| `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` | `-DSDL_VIDEO_DRIVER_WAYLAND=1` | exposes `SDL_SysWMinfo`'s Wayland fields so the dmabuf tier compiles (see below) |
| `DSPERATE_WAYLAND` | `ON` | build the Wayland dmabuf tier; the build fails rather than substituting the stub |
| `DSPERATE_CHEEVOS_VERSION` | `2.1.1` | passed explicitly; a shallow checkout has no tags for upstream's `git describe` fallback |
| `DSPERATE_PGO` | `use` | consume the pak's own trained aarch64 profile (see below) |
| `DSPERATE_PGO_DIR` | `/standalone/pgo/aarch64` | the locked profile; `build-dsperate.sh` verifies its sha256 before the build |
| `DSPERATE_PGO_STRICT` | `ON` | keeps GCC's missing-profile and coverage-mismatch warnings; the build counts them and fails (see below) |

`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is the pinned commit's committer timestamp
(`1789871851`). `DSPERATE_LOCK_VERSION=v2.1.1` and
`DSPERATE_LOCK_COMMIT=baec965` are exported from the lock so `--version` is
deterministic.

## Profile-guided optimisation

The build consumes a PGO profile trained with **this same toolchain** (Buildroot
GCC 12.3.0) and these same flags, against the patched v2.1.1 source. Upstream
v2.1.1 ships profiles for GCC 10.5 and 12.4.0 only; CMake's fingerprint check
refuses those, and a `.gcda` is bound to the compiler that wrote it, so they
cannot be used here. The profile was retrained for the port rather than carried
from v2.0.0, whose profile is tied to the v2.0.0 source. The profile in this revision
was retrained over the tree with patch 0005 applied (MANIFEST date
2026-09-21T20:20Z). The adapter's code sits in the never-trained achievement
and SDL frontend groups, so a later change to it leaves every trained object's
profile valid. The strict gate checks that on every build.

How the profile was produced (see `standalone/pgo/aarch64/MANIFEST`):

- an instrumented headless build (`-DDSPERATE_PGO=generate`) configured with the
  release flags, whose `pgo-fingerprint` matched the release build's
  (`e5053f2d1f5b27e9ed70bda94b614845979aa599`);
- seven of upstream's recorded scenes (`mlbis sm64 etody dbori meteos gsdd
  nsmb`), with the real BIOS and firmware. `st` is absent because the recorded
  save state is for another ROM revision, which the loader refuses;
- the resulting `.gcda` files, the `MANIFEST`, and a sha256 over the whole
  directory, pinned in `upstream.lock.json`. The build refuses a profile whose
  directory hash does not match the lock, and CMake refuses one whose compiler
  or flags (the MANIFEST fingerprint) do not match the build.

Verification is part of every build. The release build itself runs with
`-DDSPERATE_PGO_STRICT=ON`, and `build-in-container.sh` counts the warnings the
same way upstream's `tools/pgo_refresh.sh` does: it fails if any object outside
the never-trained groups (the SDL frontend, rcheevos and the achievement code,
the standalone tools, miniz, the reference kernels) has no profile, if any
function's control flow no longer matches its profile, or if no strict warning
appears at all. The current build reports 49 objects without a profile, all in
those groups (the adapter's two new files among them), and 0 mismatches. The strict flags are warning switches only; the
binary is byte-identical to the non-strict build. `make test-pgo` checks,
without a build or a device, that the profile directory, its MANIFEST and the
build flags match the lock. Two clean `FORCE=1` builds with the locked profile
agree byte for byte.
Device performance of this candidate must be re-measured before any claim; no
measurement of the retrained profile exists yet.

## Archives

`make dist-pakrat` and `make dist-source` write the pak ZIP and the
corresponding-source tarball with `scripts/make-archive.py`, run inside the
same pinned image so the Python and zlib doing the compression are fixed.
Entries are sorted, every timestamp is `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, owner and group are
0 with no names, modes are 0755 or 0644, the ZIP has no extra fields and the
gzip header has no name or timestamp. `make test-archives` builds both twice
with every input's mtime and the umask changed in between and requires the
same sha256. `make test-version` extracts the source archive, rebuilds from it
with no git, and requires the locked binary and `DSperate v2.1.1 (baec965)`.

## Linkage

`readelf -d` on the stripped artifact reports exactly:

```text
libSDL2-2.0.so.0
libstdc++.so.6
libm.so.6
libgcc_s.so.1
libc.so.6
```

Every one is provided by the MLP1 in `/lib`; the pak bundles no shared
libraries. The artefact is AArch64, stripped, carries no RPATH/RUNPATH and its
highest glibc symbol version is `GLIBC_2.38`, the device's glibc.

## Artifacts

The notice program is the fullscreen message the wrapper shows when a launch
cannot proceed. It links only SDL2 and SDL_ttf, both provided by the MLP1, and
resolves the launcher's own font at runtime; the pak bundles neither a library
nor a font. It is verified with the same AArch64/stripped/glibc/allowlist checks
as the emulator (see `build/standalone/verify-notice.txt`).

## The Wayland dmabuf tier is built

The MLP1's own `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` (2.28.5) is built with its Wayland video
driver, but the toolchain sysroot's SDL2 2.28.5 is a KMSDRM-only build:
`SDL_config.h` leaves `SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER_WAYLAND` undefined, so `SDL_syswm.h`
hides `SDL_SysWMinfo`'s Wayland fields and DSperate's dmabuf tier cannot
compile against those headers.

The build defines `SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER_WAYLAND=1` for this pak only. That exposes
the header fields; it does not, and cannot, add a Wayland driver to a runtime
SDL that lacks one. The fields live in SDL's public `SDL_SysWMinfo` union,
whose reserved space is the same whether or not the macro is set, and the
binary is dynamically linked to the device's Wayland-capable SDL. The dmabuf
tier loads `libwayland-client.so.0` with `dlopen` at runtime, so `libwayland`
is not a link-time dependency.

Independent ABI check (2026-09-16), compiled for AArch64 with the pinned SDK:
`sizeof(SDL_SysWMinfo) = 72`, `offsetof(info) = 8`, Wayland member size 64,
`offsetof(info.wl.surface) = 16`, and `offsetof(info.wl.xdg_toplevel) = 48`.
The public structure size and union offset agree with and without the define.
A separate full build with the define reproduced the then-pinned v1.15.1 artifact hash.
This check applies to these pinned SDL 2.28.5 headers and the qualified device
SDL; changing the SDK or runtime SDL requires checking the ABI again.

Evidence in the pinned artifact: `strings` shows `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`,
`zwp_linux_dmabuf_feedback_v1`, `/dev/dma_heap` and `libwayland-client.so.0`,
and the `NEEDED` set is unchanged from the window-surface-only build. The build
also fails if CMake's Wayland probe or the compilation of `display_wl.cpp`
does not confirm the real tier, so a silently stubbed build cannot ship.

The dmabuf allocation, Weston import, orientation and performance are qualified
on the device separately; the SDL window-surface route remains the fallback.

## v2.0.0 verification (historical)

The v2.0.0 release checks below are retained as history. The v2.1.1 candidate in
this revision is host-verified only: the patched source builds with the retrained
GCC 12.3.0 profile to `0780d7dc…`, two clean `FORCE=1` builds agree, the strict
profile check passes, `--version` reports
`v2.1.1 (baec965)` from the lock, and `make check`, `make dist-pakrat` and
`make dist-source` pass (118 wrapper checks, 14 MLP1 profile checks, the
27 pinned account fixtures, the account state and bridge fault tests, and
packaged-tree validation). Device requalification of v2.1.1, including the
performance the new profile must re-measure and a native sign-in with this
exact build, is pending.

Two clean `FORCE=1` builds agreed on both artifact hashes. The SDK, flags and
runtime library allowlist are unchanged. The larger emulator contains the new
DSi core, generated system fonts and vendored networking code. The package
carries FreeBIOS, miniz, rcheevos, ENet, libslirp and both font notices in
`LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.txt`, copied from the exact pinned source; the complete
corresponding source retains all file-level notices.

Checks passed on 2026-09-17:

- 82 wrapper checks and 14 MLP1 profile checks.
- Seven real-executable archive CLI checks (raw, stored, deflated, ambiguous,
  opt-in selection, unsafe path and malformed ZIP).
- Eight upstream AArch64 tests in the pinned container: `scheduler`,
  `cart_save`, `fastmem`, `spu`, `config`, `input`, `firmware` and `zip`.
- AArch64, stripping, GLIBC ceiling, library allowlist and real Wayland backend.

Run the archive check against a Linux executable with
`python3 tests/test-archive-cli.py /path/to/dsperate`. In the pinned AArch64
container, prefix the executable with the SDK's `lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1`
and `--library-path` naming its `lib` and `usr/lib` directories.

The patched v2.0.0 build passed MLP1 launch, controls, save faults, sleep and
sustained pacing checks on 2026-09-17. The locked PGO build was subsequently
installed on the same device; both core pickers, selection persistence after a
device reboot, the visible `.7z` refusal and stick-driven stylus input were
verified there. Local Pak Rat install/reinstall/uninstall passed and preserved
all 35 tested settings, save and state files byte for byte.
DSiWare, NAND/SD persistence and networking are not
qualified Leaf features in this update. The pak version is `2.0.0`.
